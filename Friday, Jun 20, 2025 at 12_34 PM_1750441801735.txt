What if you could tag cancer before the knife ever touched it?
What if surgery wasn’t the first strike—just the final blow?
What if there was a system that marked, weakened, and tracked rogue cells in real time…
Before, during, and after the tumor was removed?

You’d call it futuristic.
We call it EchoCell.
